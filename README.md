# tun - multi-hop reverse proxy

`tun` is a multi-hop reverse ssh proxy. When it starts it connects to a remote host via a chain of SSH servers.  It then creates a listen port on the last server in the chain.  Whenever a connection is made to this listen port, the connection is proxied back to the originating host and connected to a *target*.

## Installing

```shell
go install github.com/borud/tun/cmd/tun@latest
```

## Example usage

```shell
tun --key ~/.ssh/tunkey                 \
    --via user@jump1.example.com:22     \
    --via user2@jump2.example.com:22    \
    --target localhost:22               \
    --remote-listen-addr localhost:2222
```

1. This first connects to `jump1.example.com`.
2. Then `jump1.example.com` connects to `jump2.example.com`
3. since `jump2.example.com` is last in the chain it opens a listen port on `localhost:2222`
4. when connections are made to `localhost:2222` on `jump2.example.com` the connection
   is proxied back to the starting host and connected to `localhost:22`

The `--via` command line options are applied in order and you can have as many of them as you like.  You must have at least one.

## Tips

When using this you may not want to run the tunneling through your login account on jump nodes. You should probably set up a dedicated user for tunneling. You can then limit what this account is allowed to do through the SSHD config.  

Let's say we create a user `tun`.  You can then add some restrictions to what this user can do:

```text
# example of sshd config entry to neuter the tun user a bit.
Match User tun
  PasswordAuthentication no
  AllowTcpForwarding yes
  X11Forwarding no
  AllowAgentForwarding no
  ForceCommand /bin/false
  Banner none
  PrintLastLog no
```
